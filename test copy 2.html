                        communications and represent efforts to get to know you and your preferences better across our
                        Services and those of our affiliates. In turn, this enables customization of the services in
                        line with those preferences.</p>

                            Content under this Agreement (as described above) by opting to provide the Yaan LLC with a
                            more limited license as described further below (such limited license to be referred to
                            herein as a “Restricted License”).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">You may make this election by selecting such Restricted License grant here (note
                            that to do so you shall need to be logged into your account).</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">If you make this election, the rights you grant the Yaan LLC to your Content
                            pursuant to the license terms set forth above (referred to as the “Standard License”) shall
                            be limited in some important ways described in paragraphs 1 through 6 directly below, such
                            that the Yaan LLC shall not hold a Standard License to any of your Content other than the
                            text-based reviews and associated bubble ratings you post (as to which the Yaan LLC shall
                            continue to be granted a Standard License), but shall be granted a “Restricted License” as
                            to the balance of your Content as defined below: </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>When you post your Content to the Services, the license you grant the Yaan LLC in Your
                                Content shall be limited to a nonexclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable,
                                and worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, reproduce, publicly display
                                or perform, translate, and create derivative works of your Content for purposes of
                                displaying such on the Services, as well as using your name and/or trademark in
                                connection with that Content. Subject to Paragraph 6 below, the Restricted License
                                applies to any of your Content (again, other than text-based reviews and associated
                                bubble ratings) you or another on your behalf (e.g., a third party that contributes to
                                or otherwise manages your account) make available on or in connection with the Services.
                            </li>
                            <li>As to any individual item of your Content that is subject to the Restricted License, you
                                can terminate the Yaan LLC’ license rights hereunder to such by deleting such post from
                                the Services. Correspondingly, you may terminate the Yaan LLC’ license rights in all of
                                your Content that is subject to the Restricted License by terminating your account (a
                                description of how to do so is available here). Notwithstanding anything to the
                                contrary, your Content (a) shall remain on the Services to the extent you shared it with
                                others and they copied it or stored it prior to you deleting it or terminating your
                                account, (b) may continue to be displayed upon the Services for a reasonable amount of
                                time after you delete it or terminate your account as we seek to remove it, and/or (c)
                                may be retained (but not publicly displayed) for technical, fraud moderation, regulatory
                                or legal reasons in backup copy form for a period of time.</li>
                            <li>The Yaan LLC will not use your Content in advertisements for the products and services
                                of third parties to others without your separate consent (including sponsored Content),
                                although you agree and understand that the Yaan LLC may place advertising and promotions
                                on the Services alongside, near, adjacent, or otherwise in close proximity to your
                                Content (including, for video or other dynamic content, before, during or after its
                                presentation), as well as the Content of others. In all instances in which your Content
                                is displayed on the Services, we shall provide attribution by using the name and/or
                                trademark that you submit in connection with your Content.</li>
                            <li>The Yaan LLC will not give third parties the right to publish your Content beyond the
                                Services. However, sharing your Content on the Services (save for our “Trips” feature,
                                which can be made private) shall result in your Content being made "public" and we will
                                enable a feature that allows other users to share (by way of embedding that public post
                                or otherwise) such Content of yours (save, as noted, Trips you configure to be private)
                                onto third-party services, and we will enable search engines to make that public Content
                                of yours findable through their services.</li>
                            <li>Except as modified by paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section of this Agreement, your and
                                our rights and obligations shall remain subject to the balance of the terms of this
                                Agreement. The license you grant the Yaan LLC as modified by paragraphs 1-6 shall be
                                referred to as a “Restricted License”.</li>
                            <li>For the sake of clarity, the Content you submit to the Services in connection with other
                                Yaan LLC services or programs is not subject to the Restricted License, but shall
                                instead be governed by the terms and conditions associated with that specific Yaan
                                service or program.</li>

                            reservations with third-party suppliers without leaving the Services. By booking travel
                            reservations via the websites, you will become an Account Holder if you are not one already.
                        </p>
                        <p class="mt-3">By booking via the websites, you acknowledge that you accept the practices
                            described in our Privacy Policy and this Agreement. In addition, you warrant, either in your

                            that you possess the legal authority to enter into this Agreement and use the Services
                            (including the Yaan LLC’ booking facilitation services) in accordance with this Agreement,

                        <p class="mt-3">You further agree that you will use the Yaan LLC’ booking facilitation services
                            only to make legitimate reservations for you or others for whom you are legally authorized
                            to act. Any false or fraudulent reservation is prohibited, and any user who attempts such a
                            reservation may have his or her account terminated.</p>

                            <li>THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF YOUR PASSWORD OR ACCOUNT COULD CAUSE YOU TO INCUR LIABILITY TO

                        </ol>
                        <p class="mt-3">When you book a reservation facilitated by Yaan LLC, your payment information
                            will be collected and transmitted to the supplier to complete the transaction, as described
                            in our Privacy Policy. Please note that the supplier, not the Yaan LLC, is responsible for
                            processing your payment and fulfilling your reservation</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">The Yaan LLC will not interfere with reservations arbitrarily but reserve the
                            right to withdraw booking facilitation services because of certain extenuating
                            circumstances, such as when a reservation is no longer available or when we have reasonable
                            cause to suspect that a reservation request may be fraudulent. The Yaan LLC also reserves
                            the right to take steps to verify your identity to process your reservation request.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">In the unlikely event that a reservation is available when you place an order
                            but become unavailable prior to check-in, your sole remedy will be to contact the supplier
                            to make alternative arrangements or to cancel your reservation.</p>

                        <li>Third-Party Suppliers</li>
                        <p class="mt-3">The Yaan LLC is not a travel agency and does not provide or own transportation
                            services, accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities, or experiences. Although the Yaan
                            LLC displays information about properties owned by third-party suppliers and facilitates
                            reservations with certain suppliers on or through the Yaan LLC’s websites, such actions do
                            not in any way imply, suggest, or constitute the Yaan LLC’s sponsorship or approval of
                            third-party suppliers, or any affiliation between the Yaan LLC and third-party suppliers.
                        </p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Although Account Holders may rate and review particular transportation services,
                            accommodations, restaurants, tours, activities, or experiences based on their own
                            experiences, the Yaan LLC does not endorse or recommend the products or services of any
                            third-party suppliers, save that Yaan does issue certain businesses awards that are based on
                            the reviews posted by Account Holders.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">The Yaan LLC does not endorse any Content posted, submitted, or otherwise
                            provided by any user or business, or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed
                            therein, and the Yaan LLC expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with such
                            Content. You agree that Yaan LLC is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of
                            information they obtain from third-party suppliers and display on the Services.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">Those corporate affiliates of Yaan syndicate their advertisements to other
                            entities within the Yaan LLC group and that is why you see them on the Yaan LLC’ websites.
                            As a user, you must be responsible for your use of the Services (including, in particular,
                            the Yaan LLC’ websites), and any transaction involving Vacation Rentals, Restaurants or

                            between you and an Advertiser, including the quality, condition(s), safety or legality of a
                            listed Vacation Rental, Restaurant or Experience, the accuracy of the listing Content, the
                            Advertiser’s ability to rent a Vacation Rental property, provide you with a reservation,
                            meal or other service at a Restaurant or provide an Experience, or your ability to pay for a
                            Vacation Rental property, a Restaurant meal or service or an Experience, is solely the
                            responsibility of each user.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">One of Yaan’ corporate affiliates may act as an Advertiser’s limited agent
                            solely for the purpose of transmitting your payment to the Advertiser. You agree to pay an
                            Advertiser, or a Yaan corporate affiliate acting as limited payment collection agent on
                            behalf of an Advertiser, any specified fee(s) charged by the Advertiser for any Vacation
                            Rental reservation or Experience.</p>

                        <p class="mt-3">For further information on Vacation Rental fees, security deposits, fees for
                            Experiences, payment processing, refunds and the like, please consult our affiliates’ terms
                            and conditions. By making a Vacation Rental reservation, Restaurant reservation or
                            Experience reservation facilitated by one of our corporate affiliates, you will have to
                            acknowledge and agree to its terms and conditions, as well as its privacy policy.</p>

                            <p class="mt-3">When you book international travel reservations with third-party suppliers
                                or plan international trips using the Services, you are responsible for ensuring that
                                you meet all foreign entry requirements and that your travel documents, including
                                passports and visas, are in order.
                                For passport and visa requirements, please consult the relevant embassy or consulate for
                                information. Because requirements may change at any time, be sure to check for
                                up-to-date information before booking and departure.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">The Yaan LLC accepts no liability for travelers who are refused entry onto a
                                flight or into any country because of the traveler’s failure to carry the travel
                                documents required by any airline, authority, or country, including countries the
                                traveler may just be passing through en route to his or her destination.
                                It is also your responsibility to consult your physician for current recommendations on
                                inoculations before you travel internationally and to ensure that you meet all health
                                entry requirements and follow all medical guidance related to your trip.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is
                                completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than
                                others. Yaan urges travelers to investigate and review travel prohibitions, warnings,
                                announcements, and advisories issued by their own governments and destination country
                                governments prior to booking travel to international destinations.</p>
                            <p class="mt-3">For example, information on conditions in various countries and the level of
                                risk associated with travel to particular international destinations is provided by the
